## MERN Stack
Our tech stack choice was based on the team members' familiarity and knowledge with various existing technologies.

### MongoDB
MongoDB is a NoSQL DBMS where data is stored in the form of documents having key-value pairs similar to JSON objects. MongoDB enables users to create databases, schemas, and tables. It offers the Mongo shell that provides a JS interface for deleting, querying, and updating the records.

### ExpressJS
ExpressJS is a NodeJS framework that simplifies writing the backend code. It saves you from creating multiple Node modules. For keeping the code precise, ExpressJS offers a range of middleware.

### ReactJS
ReactJS is a JS library that allows the development of user interfaces for mobile apps and SPAs. It allows you to code JavaScript and develop UI components. The JS library uses virtual DOM for doing everything.

### NodeJS
NodeJS is an open-source JavaScript runtime environment that allows users to run code on the server. It comes with the node package manager or npm, enabling users to select from a wide selection of node modules or packages.

## Supporting Tools
**Visual Studio Code (VSC)**: a streamlined code editor with extensive support for development operations such as debugging, task running, and version control.

## Releases
